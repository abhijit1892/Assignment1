# Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

This project demonstrates neural style transfer using PyTorch, specifically with the RESNET-50 model.

## Overview

The code takes a content image and a style image as input and generates a stylized image using neural style transfer. The RESNET-50 model is used for feature extraction.

## Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
- torchvision

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhijit1892/Assignment1.git
   cd neural-style-transfer
-pip install -r requirements.txt
-python neural_style_transfer.py
